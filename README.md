# Implementation
Repository containing all the code used for the implementation of the Cansat.

A Cansat's essentially a small satellite contained in a small packaging, like the one ressembling a soda can. This Cansat was made as final project for the class of electronic instrumentation.

The team was conformed by 27 students of 8th semester of Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Industrial de Santander located in Bucaramanga, capital city of the department of Santander in Colombia. In order to design and implement this project, the human resources were distributed along 7 different subsystems which existed with the purpose of focusing the work involving different technical aspects of the satellite.

Cansat's Subsystems:
1- Communications
2- Telemetry (Ground station)
3- Structural Design
4- Microcontroller/PCB
5- Power
6- Instrumentation
7- Deployment/Parachute

The dynamics for the functionality of the Cansat were defined to be tested while it was hanging from a drone flying at a maximum height of 100 meters.

In this repository is contained all the code used to implement this project. Note that not all the subsystems required of coding. The microcontroller used in the Cansat was an Arduino nano, therefore the coding was realized in Arduino IDE using the Arduino programming language. For the ground station a software interface was programmed by that respective team using Python.
